# VSF Data Profiler Interface System

## Direction

Intent: local data engineers, analytics leads, and demo reviewers need to run a
profiling job, understand data-quality risk, inspect table-level business
impact, follow graph evidence, and open generated artifacts without guessing
which surface owns which step.

Personality: restrained data-quality console. Dense, operational, and local
first. It should feel like a serious review tool for generated evidence rather
than a decorative upload workspace or marketing page.

Palette: graphite text, white/near-white work surfaces, cool gray rails, signal
teal for active actions, amber for warning/risk, red for blockers, and measured
blue for informational graph/runtime states.

Depth: borders and surface shifts only. No broad shadows, no decorative
gradients, no soft parchment treatment.

Signature: an evidence review stack: run controls first, then dashboard verdict,
table impact, issues, graphs, and artifact links, all tied back to generated
machine artifacts.

## Domain Exploration

Domain concepts: profiling runs, runtime events, canonical artifacts, dataset
verdict, table assessments, issue severity, DBML relationships, lineage graph,
bounded sample evidence, local-only runner.

Color world: terminal graphite, clean report paper, DuckDB-style amber warning,
teal active checks, red validation failures, blue runtime telemetry.

Defaults to avoid:

- Cream/serif/soft-gradient demo workspace. Replace with system sans, flat
  surfaces, and compact evidence panels.
- Marketing landing hero. Replace with a task console whose first viewport
  starts the local run path.
- Decorative dashboard cards. Replace with data panels that expose artifact
  names, counts, filters, and drilldown actions.

```

### Radius

Scale: 6px, 8px, 12px

Use smaller radii for controls and repeated rows. Use 12px only for major
sections, dialogs, and large dashboard panels.

### Typography

Font: system sans for all interface text. Use monospace only for table names,
artifact paths, IDs, event names, counts, and compact telemetry.

Scale: 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32.
Weights: 400, 600, 700, 800.
Data style: monospace with tabular numbers.

## Patterns

### Console Shell

- Left rail uses dark graphite with compact navigation and local-run boundary
  status.
- Main workspace uses a neutral canvas and white panels.
- Primary sequence is run setup, runtime progress, dashboard, graph/artifact
  evidence, then preflight setup details.

### Button

- Minimum height: 40px
- Radius: 8px
- Font: 13-14px, 700 weight
- Primary background: `--accent`
- Secondary background: `--surface-panel`
- Focus: 3px outline using `--focus-ring` with offset.
- Disabled: visible but muted, with unchanged layout.

### Panel

- Border: 1px solid `--border-default`
- Radius: 12px
- Padding: 16px or 20px
- Background: `--surface-panel`
- No large drop shadows. Use only border, background, and small inset shifts.

### Dashboard Evidence Rows

- Clickable chart and table-impact rows are full-width buttons.
- Labels and artifact paths use monospace where they represent generated
  identifiers.
- Rows expose status, count, rate, or health score directly; hover/focus changes
  border and background without layout shift.

### Table Impact

- Dedicated dashboard section powered by `table_assessments.json`.
- Sort by readiness risk and health score.
- Each row shows table name, role, readiness, health score, business-impact
  category, affected-column count, and relationship-risk count.
- Selecting a table impact row populates drilldown with matching issues,
  assessment detail, and artifact links.

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use a restrained local data-quality console for US-056 | The demo goal is to run the profiler and inspect generated evidence, not present a decorative upload workspace | 2026-06-16 |
| Keep the dashboard as the primary post-run surface | The strongest demo moment is verdict, table impact, graph evidence, and artifacts after the Python/DuckDB run completes | 2026-06-16 |
| Preserve artifact names and routes in UI copy and controls | The web runner is a local presenter over canonical artifacts, not a new profiling engine | 2026-06-16 |
